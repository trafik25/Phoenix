Selenium Basic files
====



These jars are for creating driver instances for each driver used with Selenium Webdriver.
These include FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver and InternetExplorerDriver
I have also included the binary object for issues with FireFox not opening or finding the exe file to run tests on a different version of FF
